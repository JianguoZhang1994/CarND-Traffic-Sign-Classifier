    "To train the model, I used the AdamOptimizer method, more information in the training pipeline code cell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen? Oringinal LeNet \n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture? Original LeNet includes 3 full connected layers, too easy overfitting\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? (Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to over fitting or under fitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.) I modify the LeNet model, reduce the full connected layers to 2 layers, and add dropout layer after the first full connected layer. \n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why? I finetuning parameters of epoches, batch_size and learning rate. The accuracy will stop learn after certain epoches, too many epoches will waste time, I set epoches to 15. The batch_size is 128, too smaller batch size will take up huge amount of memory, too large maybe affect accuracy. Learning rate is 0.001  \n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model? Drouput set to 0.5, using dropout will improve accurace significantly.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction and identify where in your code softmax probabilities were outputted.
